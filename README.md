# Class Score Tracker 

## A Word of Caution

This software is in an extremely early stage of development and should not be relied upon. Usage and data formats are still in development and may change with little to no warning. **Keep Backups or your DATA!**

## What is this?

This application is a tool for keeping track of a Teacher's classroom scores and providing an PDF printout with a calculated final score. 

Currently the grades are calculated based on the total number of points accrued, with no ability to grade things based on weighted categories. This feature should be added in future versions.

## Why does this exist?

There are Two reasons this project exists:

1. I am a teacher that is interested in learning to code and looking to build projects that will solve my specific problems.
2. I need a method to quickly input grades for a class which can output to a pdf. My job requires a hard copy of my grades for backups.

This application started as my final project for Harvard's CS50P course, but development will continue until I am satisfied with the final result.

## How do I install this?

First, Clone this repository.

Then you can follow a few different paths:

### Devcontainers 

### Pipenv 

### Requirements.txt

### Isn't there an package I can download?

Unfortunately, this application is not currently packaged for distribution. In the future I would like to add that and many other great features, but in the current state of the project this is an low priority.
