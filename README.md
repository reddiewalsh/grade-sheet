# Class Participation Gradesheet (CS50P Final Project)

#### Video Demo: <URL HERE: TODO>

### Description:

##### Introduction:

Hello, my name is Edward Walsh. I am an American that is currently living and working in Taiwan as an English Teacher. This project is a tool that I have created for my own personal use as a teacher. 

##### The Problem:

Each semester I am required to track student participation for around 20 different classes. There is no software provided for this task and each class is required to have a paper copy of the participation scores of each student on a class-by-class basis. Creating and managing these "score grids" is a time consuming and repetitive process. I need a solution that can allow me to enter the grades of each student rapidly and output a nicely formated  "score grid" with each student's daily score as well as a calculated total percentage.

##### The Solution: 

This grade sheet application is based on around reading and writing CSV files. Each CSV file represents a single class. Each use of the application will allow the user to either rapidly add scores/marks to each student for a single assignment, or (if the -o flag is passed) to output a PDF that can be printed out as the required hard-copy, or as reference.

>NOTE: As the application is still at a very early stage of development, edits and alterations to student scores must be made by manually manipulating the CSV file.
